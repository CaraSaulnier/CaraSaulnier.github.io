# Sock Calculator

## How does it work?
Fill in the required fields, eg sock measurements, gauge, desired ease (a typpical sock is 95%). Select your desired heel and toe, press the magic button and there you go!
## What do I want to add in the future?
- An option for different gauge for heels, toes, and the rest of the sock to allow for funkier stitch patterns.
- Potentially add images for the dropdown menus to display each toe and heel.
- More pink
